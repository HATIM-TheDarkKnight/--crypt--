# a-console-game

***A simple logic game, where the player has to crack the code, that is generated, by guessing the code digit by digit as per the output of the Game-Machine, for each attempt.<br><br>
Attempts are limited for each of the three levels (easy/medium/hard) of the game.<br><br>
And no repeated digits are there in the code (0 - 9).<br><br>
A Player can attempt to crack the code 8 times.<br><br>
Guess the code digit by digit. After entering your code, the Game-Machine prints :  
^ C - Arc (Incomplete Circle): C means that  of the digits entered is present in the code, but not in the correct position.  
^ O - Circle (Complete Circle): O means that  of the digits entered is present in the code and is in the correct position.  
 For eg, Let the Code be '4836' and let your entry is '1234', then the Game-Machine generates "OC" -  
   O represents the digit 3 which is present and also in correct position in the code.  
   C represents the digit 4 which is present in the code, but not in the correct position.***
